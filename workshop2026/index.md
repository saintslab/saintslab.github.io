        The Sustainable Artificial Intelligence for Sciences (SAINTS) Lab is pleased to announce a technical workshop scheduled for June 12, 2026, at the University of Copenhagen. This event serves as a forum for examining the intersection of computational efficiency and ecological responsibility. As machine learning models scale in complexity, the necessity for robust frameworks that quantify and mitigate carbon intensity becomes paramount. This workshop addresses these challenges through the dual lens of the sustainability of AI and the application of AI to solve scientific sustainability problems.

      <h2 class="category">Series of Technical Talks</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Foundations of Resource-Efficient Machine Learning</strong><br>
        <em>Raghavendra Selvan, Principal Investigator</em><br>
        This session interrogates the theoretical boundaries of algorithmic efficiency. It shifts the focus from accuracy-centric metrics toward energy-delay products and hardware-aware optimizations as primary objectives in model selection.

        <strong>Operationalizing Carbon Awareness with Carbontracker 2.0</strong><br>
        <em>Sophia Wilson, PhD Student</em><br>
        An analysis of the updated Carbontracker framework, demonstrating real-time integration with global energy grid APIs. The talk covers predictive modeling of carbon intensity during long-running training sessions and the implementation of automated green-scheduling to shift workloads to periods of high renewable energy availability.

        <strong>Pruning and Quantization Strategies for Scientific Foundation Models</strong><br>
        <em>Tong Chen, Postdoc</em><br>
        This presentation details methods for reducing the parameter footprint of large-scale models without compromising downstream performance. It focuses on structured pruning and low-bitwidth quantization specifically tailored for the high-precision requirements of chemical and physical data modeling.

      <h2 class="category">Participants and Organizers</h2>
      <p>
        The workshop is organized by the core research team at the SAINTS Lab. <strong>Raghavendra Selvan</strong> serves as the lead organizer, with <strong>Tong Chen</strong> managing the technical program. Research demonstrations and logistical support are provided by <strong>Sophia Wilson</strong>, <strong>Pedram Bakhtiarifard</strong>, <strong>Jonathan V. Wenshøj</strong>, and <strong>Mikkel Dahl</strong>.
      </p>

      <h2 class="category">Location and Logistics</h2>
      <p>
        The workshop will be held at the <strong>H.C. Ørsted Institute (HCØ)</strong>, within the North Campus of the University of Copenhagen. 
        <br><strong>Venue:</strong> Alf Ross Auditorium (Room 9A.3.01)
        <br><strong>Address:</strong> Universitetsparken 5, 2100 København Ø, Denmark
      </p>

      <p>
        The event is structured as a hybrid session, combining physical attendance for local researchers with a synchronous digital stream for the international scientific community. Registration is required to manage venue capacity.
