I am a first-year PhD student with a research focus on the environmental impact of big data and strategies for reducing dataset size, including addressing dark data. I hold an MSc in Computational Physics from the Niels Bohr Institute, UCPH.

I am also committed to promoting women in STEM and enjoy engaging in outreach activities aimed at inspiring younger audiences.
